CodeIgniter 3 Starter Template by JoseLuis Gomez Cece√±a
###################


This is a starter template for CodeIgniter 3.1.11.
It is based on the default template that comes with CodeIgniter,
but with some modifications to make it easier to use.

It includes:

- Htaccess file to make the URLs look cleaner and to prevent direct access to the application files.
- Auto loaded most commonly used libraries and helpers.
- Pages controller with a default view for static pages.
- Bootstrap 5.2.1.
- jQuery 3.6.0.

CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people
who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects
much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing
a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple
interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets
you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed
for a given task.

such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
